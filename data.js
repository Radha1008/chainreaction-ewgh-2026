// ChainReaction — habit & attack-chain data
// This is the actual security-engineering substance of the app: every habit is
// tagged with a role in a kill chain (entry / weakness / signal), each role has
// hand-written narrative fragments, and a generic assembler (see app.js) can
// build a coherent, plausible attack chain from *any* combination that includes
// at least one entry point and one weakness — not just a fixed list of combos.
// A small set of named, hand-authored scenarios below still take priority when
// they apply, for extra narrative richness on common combinations.
//
// Each habit also carries a primaryThreat tag, used by the separate Threat
// Model view: a different lens on the same selections, surfacing which kind
// of attacker your specific combination is most relevant to.

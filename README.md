# Chain Reaction

A privacy-first attack-path simulator. It shows how ordinary habits chain together into an attack path, and the smallest change that breaks the chain.

**Live demo:** https://radha1008.github.io/chainreaction-ewgh-2026/

## What it is

Most security advice is a list of rules with no visible cause and effect. Chain Reaction shows the cause and effect. You pick habits a person actually has, and the app draws the path an attacker could walk from one habit to the next. Then it points at the single link that costs the least to break and shows what happens to the path when you break it.

## Who it is for

Everyday people, not security teams. It was built with women facing harassment, impersonation and scams in mind, since those chains usually start from public profile details rather than from malware.

Built for the Elevate Women Global Hackathon 2026.

## How it works

- **Deterministic rules engine.** Every chain, score and recommendation comes from hand-written rules in `data.js`. The same inputs always produce the same output. There is no model call and nothing is generated at runtime.
- **Guided job-seeker walkthrough.** A step-by-step scenario that follows one person through a fake recruiter approach and shows each link as it forms.
- **Attacker view.** The same profile rewritten as what an attacker sees and can use, instead of what the defender is told to fix.
- **Simulate MFA.** Toggle multi-factor authentication on and watch which paths survive and which collapse.
- **Cipher.** A rule-based assistant that explains terms and the current chain. Rule-based, not a chatbot.

## Privacy

Everything runs in the browser. No accounts, no uploads, no tracking, no analytics, and nothing is stored. The demo profiles are fictional. Close the tab and there is nothing left behind.

## Limitations

- Scenarios are hand-authored, so coverage is limited to what has been written.
- The guided walkthrough only covers the job-seeker chain.
- It is educational. It is not a professional risk assessment and should not be treated as one.

## Built during the hackathon

Development began 19 September 2026 and the first commit landed 20 September 2026. Earlier work was local; it is documented by file timestamps and by Claude Code session logs.

Built with Claude Code. I directed every decision: scope, scenarios, rules, copy and design. The logo art was generated with Gemini. No third-party libraries or fonts are used.

## Next steps

- More women-focused scenarios, especially harassment and impersonation chains.
- A Quick exit button.
- Slower pacing through the walkthrough.
- People-aware risk modeling that accounts for who else is in the picture, not just the account.
